Hi, I am Moreno Colaiacovo.

I am a bioinformatician with expertise in NGS data analysis.

I am currently working as an external IT consultant at the [Joint Research Centre](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en) in Ispra, Italy. Here I provide bioinformatics support to the activities of the [EURL GMFF](https://gmo-crl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/), performing bioinformatics analyses, maintaining the current website and bioinformatics infrastructure and developing web applications.

I usually code in Python, sometimes in R. For the web development part, I mostly use Ruby on Rails and Symfony PHP frameworks. As for the databases, I love PostgreSQL!

I use GitHub for my personal projects.

If you want to reach out, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.uno/@emmecola) and [Bluesky]([https://mastodon.uno/@emmecola](https://bsky.app/profile/emmecola.bsky.social)).
